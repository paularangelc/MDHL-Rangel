                a minimum of 100 x 60 yards.Leagues, districts or associations participating in
                the state competition program that are unable to provide a field that meets these
                minimum requirements must advise the State Competition Board which will
                assign its Fields Committee to inspect the field and recommend to the Board
                whether or not a waiver of the minimum dimensions should be granted. Teams
                from leagues, districts or associations that are unable to provide an acceptable
